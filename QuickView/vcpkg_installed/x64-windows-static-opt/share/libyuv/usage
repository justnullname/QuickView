libyuv provides CMake targets:

  # Unofficial config package and target from vcpkg
  find_package(libyuv CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE yuv)

Attention:
You are using MSVC to compile libyuv. This build won't compile any
of the acceleration codes, which results in a very slow library.
