  "changelog": "**Release Date**: 2026-01-16\r\n\r\n### ⚡ Core Architecture: \"Quantum Flow\"\r\n- **Unified Scheduling & Decoding (Quantum Flow)**: Introduced a \"Fast/Slow Dual-Channel\" architecture (`FastLane` + `HeavyLanePool`) that isolates instant interactions from heavy decoding tasks.\r\n- **N+1 Hot-Spare Architecture**: Implemented a \"Capped N+1\" threading model where standby threads are kept warm for immediate response, maximizing CPU throughput without over-subscription.\r\n- **Deep Cancellation**: Granular \"On-Demand\" cancellation logic allowed for heavy formats (JXL/RAW/WebP), ensuring stale tasks (e.g., during rapid scrolling) are instantly terminated to save power.\r\n- **Direct D2D Passthrough**: Established a \"Zero-Copy\" pipeline where decoded `RawImageFrame` buffers are uploaded directly to GPU memory, bypassing GDI/GDI+ entirely.\r\n\r\n### 🎨 Visual & Rendering Refactor\r\n- **DirectComposition (Game-Grade Rendering)**: Completely abandoned the legacy SwapChain/GDI model in favor of a `DirectComposition` Visual tree.\r\n    - **Visual Ping-Pong**: Implemented a double-buffered Visual architecture for tear-free, artifact-free crossfades.\r\n    - **IDCompositionScaleTransform**: Hardware-accelerated high-precision zooming and panning.\r\n- **Native SVG Engine**: Replaced `nanosvg` with **Direct2D Native SVG** rendering.\r\n    - **Capabilities**: Supports complex SVG filters, gradients, and CSS transparency.\r\n    - **2-Stage Lossless Scaling**: Vector-based re-rasterization during deep zoom for infinite sharpness.\r\n    - *(Requirement: Windows 10 Creators Update 1703 or later)*.\r\n\r\n### 💾 Memory & Resource Management\r\n- **Arena Dynamic Allocation**: Switched to a **TripleArena** strategy using Polymorphic Memory Resources (PMR). Memory is pre-allocated and recycled (Bucket Strategy) to eliminate heap fragmentation.\r\n- **Smart Directional Prefetch**:\r\n    - **Auto-Tuning**: Automatically selects `Eco`, `Balanced`, or `Performance` prefetch strategies based on detected system RAM.\r\n    - **Manual Override**: Full user control over cache behavior.\r\n    - **Smart Skip**: Prevents \"OOM\" in Eco mode by intelligently skipping tasks that exceed the cache budget.\r\n\r\n### 🧩 Infrastructure & Metadata\r\n- **Metadata Architecture Refactor**: Decoupled \"Fast Header Peeking\" (for instant layout) from \"Async Rich Metadata\" parsing (Exif/IPTC/XMP), solving UI blocking issues.\r\n- **Debug HUD**: Added a real-time \"Matrix\" overlay (`F12`) visualizing the topology of the cache, worker lane status, and frame timings."
