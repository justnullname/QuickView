# QuickView v1.1.0 Release Notes

**This is a major release marking a significant evolution of QuickView.**
Building upon the solid foundation of JPEGView, this version introduces original features that transform the user experience, making QuickView not just a viewer, but a modern, borderless image consumption tool.

## 🚀 Major New Features (Original)

### 1. Thumbnail Gallery Navigation
*   **What it is**: A completely new way to browse your folder. Instead of just next/prev, see a filmstrip of your images at the bottom.
*   **New in v1.1.0**: Added dedicated left/right navigation arrows for independent scrolling, allowing you to peek at upcoming images without changing the main view.
*   **Design**: Modern, transparent "chevron" arrows that blend seamlessly with the UI.

### 2. True Borderless Experience
*   **What it is**: We've removed the clutter. No title bars, no ugly borders. Just your image, edge-to-edge.
*   **Chrome-style Floating Controls**: To maintain usability without borders, we've added a sleek, auto-hiding button bar (Minimize, Maximize, Close) that appears only when you need it (hover at the top).

### 3. Startup Optimization
*   **Optimization**: Eliminated the "white screen flash" on startup. QuickView now respects your dark theme from the very first millisecond.

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

*   **Zoom Text**: Fixed a glitch where zoom percentage text would overlap with the thumbnail bar.
*   **Fullscreen Interaction**: Resolved issues where dragging the window was possible in fullscreen mode.
*   **UI Stability**: Fixed various button visibility and interaction bugs.
